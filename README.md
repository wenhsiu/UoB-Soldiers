# Introduction
It is a Conwey's Solders game. For this board, it is a 7 (width) Ã— 8 (height) board with tiles on it. The lower half of the board is entirely filled with tiles (pegs), and the upper half is completely empty. A tile can move by jumping another tile, either horizontally or vertically (but never diagonally) onto an empty square. The jumped tile is then removed from the board.
